        "# What is Base URL?\n",
        "\n",
        "- baseURL is a configuration option in Playwright that defines a default root URL for your tests.\n",
        "- Instead of writing full URLs in every test (e.g., await page.goto(\"http://localhost:3000/login\")), you can just use relative paths like await page.goto(\"/login\").\n",
        "- This makes tests cleaner, easier to maintain, and environment-independent (dev, staging, prod).\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 How it Works\n",
        "- When you set baseURL in the Playwright config, Playwright automatically prepends it to any relative path used in navigation.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "// baseURL = \"http://localhost:3000\"\n",
        "await page.goto(\"/settings\");\n",
        "- This will navigate to http://localhost:3000/settings.\n",
        "- It’s especially useful when switching between environments (local, CI/CD, staging) without rewriting test code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. If we give any other URL for other programs, it will consider the fully entered URL only, when we enter '/' for example, then it will consider the baseURL.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. we cannot enter more than one URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. If we enter baseURL as orangeHRM and give half link on saucedemo code, it will open the browser, but display's \"Not found\", The requested URL was not found on this server."
